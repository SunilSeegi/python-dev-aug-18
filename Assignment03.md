4. Write a Python class named `Circle` constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.

5. Write a python class with name `List` which behaves like the `list` data structure in Python. Initially, the `List` object must store an empty list. It should have following methods:
	- `size()`: return the size of List
	- `append(x)`: add new element `x` to List
	- `pop(idx)`: remove element at index `idx` from the list
	- Magic functions like `__str__`, `__add__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__lte__`, `__gte__`, `__add__`, `__mul__` and `__getitem__`.


6. Write a Python program to read last `n` lines of a file.

7. Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.
